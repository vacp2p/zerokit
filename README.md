# Zerokit

A set of Zero Knowledge modules, written in Rust and designed to be used in other system programming environments.

## Initial scope

Focus on RLN and being able to use [Circom](https://iden3.io/circom) based
version through ark-circom, as opposed to the native one that currently exists
in Rust.

## Acknowledgements

- Uses [ark-circom](https://github.com/gakonst/ark-circom), Rust wrapper around Circom.

- Inspired by Applied ZKP group work, e.g. [zk-kit](https://github.com/appliedzkp/zk-kit).

- [RLN library](https://github.com/kilic/rln) written in Rust based on Bellman.

- [semaphore-rs](https://github.com/worldcoin/semaphore-rs) written in Rust based on ark-circom.

- The circom witness calculation code of the rln crate is based on [circom-witnesscalc](https://github.com/iden3/circom-witnesscalc) by iden3. The execution graph file used by this code has been generated by means of the same iden3 software.
