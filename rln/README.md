# Zerokit RLN Module

This module provides APIs to manage, compute and verify [RLN](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/32/) zkSNARK proofs and RLN primitives.

## Pre-requisites

### Install dependencies and clone repo

```sh
make installdeps
git clone https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit.git
cd zerokit/rln
```

 ~~### Build and Test~~

 ~~To build and test, run the following commands within the module folder~~

``` ~~bash~~
 cargo make build
 cargo make test
```

### Compile ZK circuits

The `rln` (https://github.com/rate-limiting-nullifier/circom-rln) repository, which contains the RLN circuit implementation is a submodule of zerokit RLN.

To compile the RLN circuit

```sh
# Update submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install rln dependencies
cd vendor/rln/ && npm install

# Build circuits
./scripts/build-circuits.sh rln

# Copy over assets
cp build/zkeyFiles/rln-final.zkey ../../resources/tree_height_15
cp build/zkeyFiles/rln.wasm ../../resources/tree_height_15
```

Note that the above code snippet will compile a RLN circuit with a Merkle tree of height equal `15` based on the default value set in `vendor/rln/circuit/rln.circom`.

In order to compile a RLN circuit with Merkle tree height `N`, it suffices to change `vendor/rln/circuit/rln.circom` to

```
pragma circom 2.0.0;

include "./rln-base.circom";

component main {public [x, epoch, rln_identifier ]} = RLN(N);
```

However, if `N` is too big, this might require a bigger Powers of Tau ceremony than the one hardcoded in `./scripts/build-circuits.sh`, which is `2^14`.
In such case we refer to the official [Circom documentation](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/proving-circuits/#powers-of-tau) for instructions on how to run an appropriate Powers of Tau ceremony and Phase 2 in order to compile the desired circuit.

Currently, the `rln` module comes with 2 [pre-compiled](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit/tree/master/rln/resources) RLN circuits having Merkle tree of height `20` and `32`, respectively.

## Getting started

### Add RLN as dependency

We start by adding zerokit RLN to our `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
rln = { git = "https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit" }
```

### Create a RLN object

First, we need to create a RLN object for a chosen input Merkle tree size.

Note that we need to pass to RLN object constructor the path where the circuit (`rln.wasm`, built for the input tree size), the corresponding proving key (`rln_final.zkey`) or (`rln_final.arkzkey`) and verification key (`verification_key.arkvkey`, optional) are found.

In the following we will use [cursors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Cursor.html) as readers/writers for interfacing with RLN public APIs.

```rust
use rln::protocol::*;
use rln::public::*;
use std::io::Cursor;

// We set the RLN parameters:
// - the tree height;
// - the tree config, if it is not defined, the default value will be set
let tree_height = 20;
let input = Cursor::new(json!({}).to_string());

// We create a new RLN instance
let mut rln = RLN::new(tree_height, input);
```

### Generate an identity keypair

We generate an identity keypair

```rust
// We generate an identity pair
let mut buffer = Cursor::new(Vec::<u8>::new());
rln.key_gen(&mut buffer).unwrap();

// We deserialize the keygen output to obtain
// the identity_secret and id_commitment
let (identity_secret_hash, id_commitment) = deserialize_identity_pair(buffer.into_inner());
```

### Add Rate commitment to the RLN Merkle tree

```rust
// We define the tree index where id_commitment will be added
let id_index = 10;
let user_message_limit = 10;

// We serialize id_commitment and pass it to set_leaf
let rate_commitment = poseidon_hash(&[id_commitment, user_message_limit]);
let mut buffer = Cursor::new(serialize_field_element(rate_commitment));
rln.set_leaf(id_index, &mut buffer).unwrap();
```

Note that when tree leaves are not explicitly set by the user (in this example, all those with index less and greater than `10`), their values is set to an hardcoded default (all-`0` bytes in current implementation).

### Set external nullifier

The `external nullifier` includes two parameters.

The first one is `epoch` and it's used to identify messages received in a certain time frame. It usually corresponds to the current UNIX time but can also be set to a random value or generated by a seed, provided that it corresponds to a field element.

The second one is `rln_identifier` and it's used to prevent a RLN ZK proof generated for one application to be re-used in another one.

```rust
// We generate epoch from a date seed and we ensure is
// mapped to a field element by hashing-to-field its content
let epoch = hash_to_field(b"Today at noon, this year");
// We generate rln_identifier from a date seed and we ensure is
// mapped to a field element by hashing-to-field its content
let rln_identifier = hash_to_field(b"test-rln-identifier");

let external_nullifier = poseidon_hash(&[epoch, rln_identifier]);
```

### Set signal

The signal is the message for which we are computing a RLN proof.

```rust
// We set our signal
let signal = b"RLN is awesome";
```

### Generate a RLN proof

We prepare the input to the proof generation routine.

Input buffer is serialized as `[ identity_key | id_index | external_nullifier | user_message_limit | message_id | signal_len | signal ]`.

```rust
// We prepare input to the proof generation routine
let proof_input = prepare_prove_input(identity_secret_hash, id_index, external_nullifier, signal);
```

We are now ready to generate a RLN ZK proof along with the _public outputs_ of the ZK circuit evaluation.

```rust

// We generate a RLN proof for proof_input
let mut in_buffer = Cursor::new(proof_input);
let mut out_buffer = Cursor::new(Vec::<u8>::new());
rln.generate_rln_proof(&mut in_buffer, &mut out_buffer)
    .unwrap();

// We get the public outputs returned by the circuit evaluation
let proof_data = out_buffer.into_inner();
```

The byte vector `proof_data` is serialized as `[ zk-proof | tree_root | external_nullifier | share_x | share_y | nullifier ]`.

### Verify a RLN proof

We prepare the input to the proof verification routine.

Input buffer is serialized as `[proof_data | signal_len | signal ]`, where `proof_data` is (computed as) the output obtained by `generate_rln_proof`.

```rust
// We prepare input to the proof verification routine
let verify_data = prepare_verify_input(proof_data, signal);

// We verify the zk-proof against the provided proof values
let mut in_buffer = Cursor::new(verify_data);
let verified = rln.verify(&mut in_buffer).unwrap();
```

We check if the proof verification was successful:

```rust
// We ensure the proof is valid
assert!(verified);
```

## Get involved!

Zerokit RLN public and FFI APIs allow interaction with many more features than what briefly showcased above.

We invite you to check our API documentation by running

```rust
cargo doc --no-deps
```

and look at unit tests to have an hint on how to interface and use them.
